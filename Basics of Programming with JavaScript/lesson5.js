/* Operators
 Here are some of the most common operators in JavaScript:

 - Assignment: = as in a = 2.
 - Math: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), and / (division), as in a * 3.
 - Compound Assignment: +=, -=, *=, and /= are compound operators that combine a math operation with
   assignment, as in a += 2 (same as a = a + 2).
 - Increment/Decrement: ++ (increment), -- (decrement), as in a++ (similar to a = a + 1).
 - Object Property Access: . as in console.log().

 Objects are values that hold other values at specific named locations called properties. obj.a means an
 object value called obj with a property of the name a. Properties can alternatively be accessed as obj["a"].
 See Chapter 2.

 Equality: == (loose-equals), === (strict-equals), != (loose not-equals), !== (strict not-equals), as in a == b.

 Comparison: < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or loose-equals), >= (greater than or loose-equals),
 as in a <= b.

 Logical: && (and), || (or), as in a || b that selects either a or b.
